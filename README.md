Interactive VR Human Skeleton

Team Members - Avika Manglick and Ishita Singh

Project Overview - This project focuses on developing an interactive 3D Human Skeleton model using Unity and Blender. The objective is to create an educational tool where users can interact with different bones of the human body. When a user hovers over or clicks on a bone, the system displays the name of the bone along with its function.
The project is designed to improve anatomical understanding through immersive and interactive learning using Virtual Reality concepts.

Features 
- 3D Human Skeleton Model
- Bone interaction using raycasting in Unity
- Information display panel for bone details
- Structured and modular project design

How the Project Works
- The 3D skeleton model is created or imported into Unity.
- Each bone is assigned an identifier and collider component.
- A C# script detects mouse hover or click using raycasting.
- The corresponding bone name and function are displayed on the UI panel.
